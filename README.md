# Generic Carousel


This Generic Carousel is a wrapper for leandrowd's react-responsive-carousel package (https://github.com/leandrowd/react-responsive-carousel). Many thanks to https://github.com/leandrowd/ for doing such a great job writing and maintaining the underlying component that this package wraps!

# Overview
This carousel widget that cycles through twelve images via the `prev` and `next` buttons. These are styled differently depending on the viewport size.

The images are fetched from UnSplash which is a public API. Once they are available to the app load them into the carousel and enable the functionality for the buttons.
